# Advanced Customer Segmentation
 I have made an advanced customer segmentation model for which I have used the  KModes algorithm which is developed by the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). For the installation of the package in Anacondaa use the following command in the Anaconda command prompt: 
    
    conda install -c conda-forge KModes
 
 I have used this algorithm because we are dealing with both categorical and numerical data in this dataset and the  KMeans algorithm can be implemented only on numerical data. Thus in the KModes package, we have used the  KPrototypes algorithm to solve the problem statement.
